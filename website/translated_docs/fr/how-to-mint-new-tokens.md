If a new native token was created when your colony was set up, your colony has the ability to mint new native tokens whenever it likes.

In order to mint new tokens for the colony, you will need the root permission. The Colony Founder has this permission by default.

Navigate to your colonyâ€™s dashboard and click the **Settings** icon âš™ next to your colonyâ€™s name.

Click on the **Tokens** tab.

Click **Mint New Tokens**.

Enter the number of tokens you would like to mint and click **Confirm**.

Yay! You just minted some tokens! ðŸŽ‰
